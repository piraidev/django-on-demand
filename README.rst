==================
 Djando On-Demand
==================

Manage suppliers and consumers in an on-demand marketplace. 
Think of it like an API to build services like Airbnb, Upwork, or any marketplace where you have suppliers offering a service or product, and consumers searching for specific characteristics of the product or service.

This app provides models and API endpoints to facilitate the implementation of the marketplace.

Endpoints
---------

* ``/search-suppliers``
* ``/users/<id>/supplier-profile`` (create, update, retrieve)
* ``/users/<id>/consumer-profile`` (create, update, retrieve)
* ``/newest-suppliers``
* ``/connection`` (create a connection between supplier and consumer, update, terminate)


Quick start
-----------

1. This app is using `django-rest-framework` to provide API endpoints, which means this app will need to be added to the list of installed apps.
The app will automatically install `django-rest-framework` if it's not installed.
`on_demand` also needs to be added to the list of installed apps::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'on_demand',
        'rest_framework'
    ]

Given that the app has models, a db client should be installed. For example `pip install mysqlclient`

2. Include the Django On Demand URLconf in your project urls.py like this::

    path('ondemand/', include('on_demand.urls')),

3. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the models.

4. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ondemand/ to test the new API.
